# simple-arbitrage-keeper

`NOTE`: This keeper is not complete. It uses pymaker and accidentally calls [`MatchingMarket.offer()`](https://github.com/makerdao/pymaker/blob/master/pymaker/oasis.py#L689), which isn't a guaranteed market buy (i.e. take order) in all permutations, so to improve this keeper, you'll need to call one of [OasisDex's Taker functions](https://oasisdex.com/docs/guides/market-taker).

This keeper performs simple arbitrage between OasisDex and Uniswap. It's structure is inspired by the original [arbitrage-keeper](www.github.com/makerdao/arbitrage-keeper), which performs arbitrage on the smart contracts powering [Oasis.app](http://oasis.app), `join`, `exit`, `boom` and `bust` in Single Collateral Dai.

This keeper constantly looks for profitable arbitrage opportunities within a token pair across OasisDex and Uniswap V1 and attempts to execute them the moment they becomes available.

It is simple in construction, utilizing the Oasis [REST Api](https://developer.makerdao.com/oasis/api/2/) and on-chain matching engine. It is also bounded by a single token pair and would increase its opportunity horizon and profitability if it evaluates all token pairs, overlapping across both exchanges.

The `opportunity` is defined as the profit amount of the best arbitrage opportunity, which follows a simple call structure:

- Sell `entry_token` and buy `arb_token` on `start_exchange`
- Sell `arb_token` and buy `entry_token` on `end_exchange`

Provided that a `TxManager` is deployed and owned by the `ETH_FROM` address, this keeper can execute contract calls atomically, meaning any failed function call will revert the entire transaction; this prevents the case where `ETH_FROM`, the account the keeper operates from, would be left with the `arb_token` if the selling function call on `end_exchange` fails.

Deployment steps and source code of the `TxManager` can be found here: [https://github.com/makerdao/tx-manager](https://github.com/makerdao/tx-manager).

**We reccommend that first time users go through the [Simple Arbitrage Keeper guide](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/keepers/simple-arbitrage-keeper/simple-arbitrage-keeper.md).**
